<p><a name="navigation"></a><br /><br /></p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>The navigation bar that appears at the top of each page can be used to navigate the database and select common functions. Alternatively return to the home page at any time by clicking ‘Artemis’ at the top left of the screen.</p>



<p><a name="search"></a><br /><br /></p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p>The search function can be accessed from the search bar that appears at the top of all pages or from the search button on the home page. To find a record simply enter search terms in the box. The search function works best with unique identiffiers for example  part or assembly ID. It is possible however to search based on any facet.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Type ‘c8m’ in the search box to return all parts whose name contains ‘c8m’</p>

<h3>Filtering</h3>
<p>Once you have completed a search you may wish to refine your results. In order to filter your search results and exclude unwanted results 
  you can use the ‘filter type’ function.</p>

<p>In the search view, at the top left there is a box called ‘filter type’ - simply select the type of information that you want to filter on. 
  Once selected the relevant terms will appear as dropdown suggestions on the search bar. Just type into the search bar to alter the suggestions 
  list, and click on any suggestions you want to add to your search.</p>

<p>To remove a search filter simply click the ‘x’ symbol next to the filter value in the search bar (where it will show up after being selected).</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>To filter for items that have a specific batch ID select ‘batch’ in the ‘filter type’ box. You will now see batch IDs listed as suggestions 
        in the search bar dropdown field.</p>

<p>Click on the batch ID number that you are looking for to add it to your search parameters.</p>

<p>Note that filtering is only valuable on particular fields. For example, if you filter on a field that is likely to be unique across all records, 
  such as the record ID, you will get little benefit - as there will be only 1 result for every value. In this case, you would be better 
  searching for the ID directly, or if you do not know it, searching for other bits of information you have about the record you are looking for.</p>



<p><a name="newpart"></a><br /><br /></p>

<h2>Add New Part</h2>

<p>To add a new part select the ‘New part’ option in the navigation bar that appears at the top of each page. Alternatively select 'New Part' 
  button on the homepage.</p>

<p>You will be presented with a blank parts record including basic fields common to most parts. Where there is information available corresponding 
  to a field enter the details. For those fields without information, leave them blank.</p>

<p>Once the fields are updated click ‘save this part’ to ensure changes are stored.</p>

<p>Note that some fields will only allow certain controlled values - in this case, select a suitable value from the dropdown list (the available options are controlled via the admin interface).</p>

<p>
  Note that the "replaces (if any)" field will only give the option for the new part to replace an old part that has ALREADY been marked as obsolete.
  So if you do wish to use new part data to replace an obsolete part record, then you should first search for that old part record via the search interface, 
  and once you find it mark it as obsolete and save it. Then return to the "New part" page and you will be able to select the ID of the part to replace 
  in the dropdown list.</p>

<p>To add a new unique field select the ‘add another field’ symbol at the bottom of the table. A dailogue box will appear, and you can enter your field name. 
  Your new field name will appear at the bottom of the fields list, and you can then provide a value for the named field.</p>

<h2>Add batches of Parts</h2>

<p>If you wish to create multiple new parts at the same time, this can be done via the <a href="/record/create/batch">Batch of new parts</a> option.</p>

<p>This works as per the "Add New Part" option, except that you can specify you many parts to create. Note, of course, that all the new parts being 
  created must have identical information provided for them. Once saved, you will be provided with a list of the IDs for the parts that were created.</p>



<p><a name="groupofids"></a><br /><br /></p>

<h2>Create a group of IDs</h2>

<p>This is the same as adding a batch of new parts - if, for example you wish to give a group of IDs to a particular manufacturer, 
  just choose to "Batch of new Parts". Then, on the new part form, specify the number of parts to create but provide no further information. 
  Alternatively, add some information to identify the reason the records were created - e.g. a note such as "issued to manufacturer X" or perhaps 
  a "manufacturer" field.</p>



<p><a name="newassembly"></a><br /><br /></p>

<h2>Add New Assembly</h2>

<p>To add a new assembly select the <a href="/record/create/assembly">New assembly</a> option in the navigation bar that appears at the top of each 
  page. Alternatively select the 'New assembly' button on the homepage.</p>

<p>You will be presented with a blank assembly record including basic fields common to most parts. 
  Where there is information available corresponding to a field enter the details. For those fields without information, leave it blank.</p>

<p>Once the fields are updated click ‘save this assembly’ to ensure changes are stored.</p>

<p>Creating a new assembly is very similiar to creating a new part, except there are some additional starting fields that can be filled in, to 
  store the extra assembly information.</p>



<p><a name="parttoassembly"></a><br /><br /></p>

<h2>Add part to Assembly</h2>

<p>Search for a part using the search page. Once found, click on the part ID to open the part page.</p>

<p>Then click the "add to an assembly" button and type in the ID of the assembly to which you wish to add the current part.
  The page will be refreshed once you submit, and you will see the assembly information on the right hand side.</p>
