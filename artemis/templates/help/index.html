<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>The navigation bar that appears at the top of each page can be used to navigate the database and select common functions. Alternatively return to the home page at any time by clicking ‘Artemis’ at the top left of the screen.</p>

<p><a name="search"></a></p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p>The search function can be accessed from the search bar that appears at the top of all pages or from the search button on the home page. To find a record simply enter search terms in the box. The search function works best with unique identiffiers for example  part or assembly ID. It is possible however to search based on any facet.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Type ‘c8m’ in the search box to return all parts whose name contains ‘c8m’</p>

<h3>Filtering - Faceted Search</h3>
<p>Once you have completed a search you may wish to refine your results. In order to filter your search results and exclude unwanted results you can use the ‘add facet filters’ function.</p>

<p>In the search view the column to the left of the search results contains a box titled ‘add facet filters’ - simply select the terms that you want to include. Once selected the relevant terms will appear at the top of left column. The relevant term in the ‘add facet filters’ box should also become highlighted.</p>

<p>If any of the terms you chose contain multiple options then select the small ‘+’ symbol next to the filter, this will present the various options available. By clicking on the relevant value you can limit search results to that category.</p>

<p>If there are a large quantity of options you can use the alphanumeric pad that will appear directly below the filter to find the term you are looking for. Additionally you can sort the results to find the term you are looking for using the functions in the bottom row of the box.</p>

<p>To remove a search filter simply click the ‘x’ symbol next to relevant category.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>To filter for items that have a specific batch ID select ‘BATCH_ID’ in the ‘add facet filters’ box. You should see that ‘BATCH_ID’ is now highlighted. At the top of the column a menu item ‘+ batch_id’ will appear. Click on the ‘+’ symbol and the available options will expand below. You can filter these options using the alphanumeric pad.</p>

<p>Click on the batch ID number that you are looking for</p>

<p>However, note that facet filtering is only valuable on particular fields. For example, if you facet on a field that is unique across all records, such as the record ID, you will get little benefit - as there will be only 1 result for every value. In this case, you would be better searching for the ID directly, or if you do not know it, searching for other bits of information you have about the record you are looking for.</p>
